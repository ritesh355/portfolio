# 🚀 Next.js Portfolio – DevOps Ready

This is my **personal portfolio project** built with **Next.js**, containerized with **Docker**, deployed on **AWS EC2 (Free Tier)**, and automated with **GitHub Actions CI/CD** + **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code.

It demonstrates both **frontend skills (React/Next.js)** and **DevOps practices (CI/CD, Docker, Cloud, IaC)**.
